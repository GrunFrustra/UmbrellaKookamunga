Project description: In this project, I implemented a working game with an objective, as well as cleaning up some issues that
I had in the project.

The Specs that I implemented are:  1. Game Objective
				   2. Complex Rainfall
                                   3. Video

The Specs that I was unable to implement are: Game Objective

Extras:  A custom, open-source font called GOODGIRL.TTF was used for display purposes.

Future game idea:  For this game, I would like to create something similar to a twin-stick shooter, that will allow the player
to shoot in multiple directions to clear enemies off the field.  The player will be able to move and shoot in multiple directions
at the same time, clearing the screen of enemies of various sizes.  Score would be able to keep tracked of, and a high school leaderboard
can be kept as a static viewable screen on the computer.
